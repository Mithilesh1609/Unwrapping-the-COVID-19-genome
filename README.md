# Unwrapping-the-COVID-19-genome

- Here we will try to answering some of the questions of **bio-informatics** in regards to the recent panademic outbreak of **Corona virus(COVID-19)**, from a **non-medical background person's perspective**. 
Every analysis presented here is based on the stuff I learnt and understood (or felt that I actually understood) about **the genomes from the internet**.

## Basic Context

- First Question comes to our mind is **what is genome?**
  - [Genomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome) are considered to be **genetic material of any organism**. It consists of **[DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA)(or [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA))** which in turn can be considered as the **blueprints of any organism's origin.**
