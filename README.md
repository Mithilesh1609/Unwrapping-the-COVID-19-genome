# Unwrapping-the-COVID-19-genome

- Here we will try to answering some of the questions of **bio-informatics** in regards to the recent panademic outbreak of **Corona virus(COVID-19)**, from a **non-medical background person's perspective**. 
Every analysis presented here is based on the stuff I learnt and understood (or felt that I actually understood) about **the genomes from the internet**.
