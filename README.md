# Unwrapping-the-COVID-19-genome

- Here we will try to answering some of the questions of **bio-informatics** in regards to the recent panademic outbreak of **Corona virus(COVID-19)**, from a **non-medical background person's perspective**. 
Every analysis presented here is based on the stuff I learnt and understood (or felt that I actually understood) about **the genomes from the internet**.

## flow of work of the python code.
- Some Context
- Comparison of composition of genomes
  - Oligonucleotide composition
  - GC Content
- Proteins & Amino Acids
- Protein Strands by genome
- Amino Acids Distribution
- Finding the ORFs
- Summary of Protein Sequences
- Sequence Alignment
- Pairwise Sequence Alignment
- Genome Sequence Similarity
- Generating a Phylogenetic Tree
- Clustering all COVID-19 patients' genomes
- Conclusions
